# pcp_hf
Experimenting with the PCP_HF tool for heart failure prediction.

The tool predicts the likelihood of heart failure developing within the next 10 years. Note - the sex and race requirements and limited options available for the algorithm were set by data available in the paper below. Streamlit is used to enable web access to the python output. See streamlit documentation here: https://docs.streamlit.io/
